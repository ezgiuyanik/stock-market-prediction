# Stock Market Data Prediction Using Artificial Intelligence

## Overview
This project aims to predict stock market trends using artificial intelligence. I have pulled stock market data for the last 5 years via an API and developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for future predictions. The project also includes a web interface created with React and Tailwind CSS to visualize predictions and key insights in real-time.

## Project Status
*Current Status:* Under Construction  
*Funding:* TÜBİTAK 2209-A Supported Project

## Features
- *Data Retrieval:* Stock market data is fetched using APIs, specifically focusing on BIST 100 data.
- *AI Model Development:* Developed and trained an LSTM model to forecast future stock prices.
- *Web Interface:* Designed a responsive web application using React and Tailwind CSS to present the predictions.
- *Real-time Visualization:* The web interface displays predictions and insights in real time for end-users.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language:* Python
- *Machine Learning Frameworks:* TensorFlow, Keras
- *Web Development:* React, Tailwind CSS
- *Data Processing Libraries:* Pandas, NumPy
- *Version Control:* Git, GitHub

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/ezgiuyanik/stock-market-prediction.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   bash
   cd stock-market-prediction
   
3. Install the required Python packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
4. Start the web application:
   bash
   npm start
   

## Usage
- Access the web application in your browser.
- The application will display the current predictions and insights based on the LSTM model.
- Continue to refine the model and web interface as the project develops.

## Future Work
- Continue training the LSTM model with updated data to improve accuracy.
- Enhance the web interface design and user experience.
- Add more features for deeper analysis and insights.
